# Frequently Asked Questions

## I'm an app developer. Why should I choose Aurora over other EVMs?

Aurora was built by the same team that created the NEAR Protocol, considered to be among the most highly regarded blockchain technologies in the crypto space. Although created at NEAR, Aurora will be exist as a separate entity, governed by the decentralized AuroraDAO, and will leverage the unique underlying NEAR technologies to align incentives of the network, product owners, and end users. When you choose to deploy your app on Aurora, you're partnering with a highly-capable and dedicated organization, and building upon a technical foundation that will scale to meet all your future needs.

## What are the basic performance metrics?

## How will transaction fees work?

The base fee token of Aurora is ETH, which will make your users feel right at home. By leveraging the underlying low-cost capabilities of the NEAR Protocol, Aurora transactions will typically cost pennies. What's particularly interesting, is that the underlying fee model of NEAR opens the door to innovative possibilities, such as AuroraDAO directed mechanisms of channeling a portion of collected fees back to the projects running on Aurora!

## What does the high-level roadmap look like?

## How do I get started with Aurora?

The Aurora EVM has been deployed on the NEAR Mainnet and Testnet networks. Asset connectors--e.g. our "ETH Connector" and "ERC-20 Connectors"--allow asset transfers between Aurora and Ethereum. Currently, the ETH Connector is deployed and functional on Testnet, with the ERC-20 Connector soon to follow. In this way, project owners should be able to test their deployments on Aurora fully in May, followed by production deployments in June of 2021. For those interested in getting started, a set of [Aurora Documents](https://doc.aurora.dev) is currently available.
